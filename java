To develop a user-friendly Expense Tracker, here’s a breakdown of the essential project components and their details:

Key Features

	1.	Expense Recording
	•	Allow users to record expenses with the following details:
	•	Amount: Decimal value for monetary expenses.
	•	Category: E.g., Food, Travel, Bills, etc.
	•	Date: Date of the expense (use a date picker in GUI).
	•	Notes: Optional text field for additional details.
	2.	Expense Display
	•	Display all recorded expenses in a table format.
	•	Columns: Date, Category, Amount, Notes.
	•	Provide filter options:
	•	Filter by date range.
	•	Filter by category.
	3.	Expense Analytics
	•	Show total expenses.
	•	Provide a breakdown of expenses by category (e.g., pie chart or list).
	4.	Data Persistence
	•	Save expenses locally for retrieval upon reopening the app.
	•	Use a file format like:
	•	CSV for human-readable storage.
	•	Serialized objects for easier data management in Java.
	5.	User-Friendly Design
	•	Simple, intuitive interface.
	•	Responsive layout for different screen sizes (if needed).
	•	Basic error handling (e.g., prevent negative amounts).

Technology Stack

	•	Language: Java
	•	GUI Framework: JavaFX or Swing (JavaFX recommended for modern applications).
	•	Data Storage: File handling (CSV or serialized data).

Development Phases

1. Expense Class

	•	Create a class to represent an expense with fields:

public class Expense {
    private double amount;
    private String category;
    private LocalDate date;
    private String notes;

    // Constructor, getters, and setters
}



2. Basic GUI Setup

	•	Use JavaFX/Swing to design the interface:
	•	Input form for adding new expenses.
	•	Table to display all expenses.
	•	Buttons for filtering and clearing filters.

3. Core Functionalities

	•	Add Expense: Capture user input and save to a list.
	•	Display Expenses: Populate the table with data.
	•	Filter: Add filtering logic to update the displayed data based on user input.
	•	Calculate Totals: Summarize total expenses and breakdown by category.

4. Data Persistence

	•	Save data to a file when the application closes.
	•	Load data from the file when the application starts.

5. Final Touches

	•	Improve the design with styling (JavaFX CSS or Swing themes).
	•	Add validation for inputs.

Optional Features (Stretch Goals)

	1.	Charts: Use JavaFX’s PieChart or BarChart for visualizing expenses.
	2.	Dark Mode: Add a toggle for light/dark themes.
	3.	Export to Excel: Enable exporting the data to an Excel file using Apache POI.
