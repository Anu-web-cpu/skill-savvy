To develop a Typing Speed Program in Java, we will create a simple application that includes the following functionalities:
	1.	Typing Test: The user will be asked to type a given text.
	2.	Timer Functionality: The time taken by the user to type the text will be tracked.
	3.	Accuracy Calculation: The accuracy of the typing will be compared to the provided text.
	4.	Results Display: The speed (in words per minute) and accuracy percentage will be displayed.
	5.	User Interface: A simple command-line interface to interact with the user.

Here is an implementation of this program step-by-step:

Step 1: Setup Java Class and Import Required Libraries

We will use the Scanner class for user input, and System.currentTimeMillis() for tracking the time.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class TypingSpeedTest {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Display welcome message and instructions
        System.out.println("Welcome to the Typing Speed Test!");
        System.out.println("You will be given a text to type. Try to type it as fast and accurately as possible.");
        System.out.println("Press ENTER to start the test.");
        
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        scanner.nextLine();  // Wait for the user to press Enter
        
        // Start typing test
        startTypingTest(scanner);
    }

    public static void startTypingTest(Scanner scanner) {
        // Define the text for the user to type
        String textToType = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
        
        System.out.println("Your text to type:");
        System.out.println(textToType);
        
        System.out.println("\nStart typing when you're ready. Press Enter to begin.");
        scanner.nextLine(); // Wait for the user to press Enter before starting the test

        // Start the timer
        long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        
        // Get the user's input
        String userInput = scanner.nextLine();
        
        // End the timer
        long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        
        // Calculate the time taken (in seconds)
        long timeTaken = (endTime - startTime) / 1000;  // Convert milliseconds to seconds
        
        // Calculate words per minute (WPM)
        int wordCount = userInput.split("\\s+").length; // Count words based on spaces
        double wpm = (wordCount / (double) timeTaken) * 60; // Words per minute
        
        // Calculate accuracy
        double accuracy = calculateAccuracy(textToType, userInput);
        
        // Display results
        displayResults(wpm, accuracy, timeTaken);
    }

    public static double calculateAccuracy(String originalText, String userInput) {
        int correctChars = 0;
        
        // Compare the user input with the original text character by character
        for (int i = 0; i < Math.min(originalText.length(), userInput.length()); i++) {
            if (originalText.charAt(i) == userInput.charAt(i)) {
                correctChars++;
            }
        }
        
        // Calculate accuracy percentage
        double accuracy = ((double) correctChars / originalText.length()) * 100;
        return accuracy;
    }

    public static void displayResults(double wpm, double accuracy, long timeTaken) {
        System.out.println("\nTest complete!");
        System.out.println("Time Taken: " + timeTaken + " seconds");
        System.out.printf("Typing Speed: %.2f words per minute\n", wpm);
        System.out.printf("Accuracy: %.2f%%\n", accuracy);
    }
}

Step 2: How the Program Works

	1.	Text to Type: The program defines a sample text "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", which is a pangram (contains every letter of the English alphabet). This is commonly used for typing tests.
	2.	Timer: The program starts the timer using System.currentTimeMillis() before the user starts typing and stops it after the user has finished typing. This calculates the time taken to type the text.
	3.	Words Per Minute (WPM): The typing speed is calculated by dividing the number of words typed by the time taken in minutes. WPM = (word count / time taken in seconds) * 60.
	4.	Accuracy: Accuracy is calculated by comparing the original text with the user’s input, character by character. It computes the number of correct characters and calculates the accuracy as a percentage.
	5.	Results: The program displays the time taken in seconds, words per minute, and the accuracy percentage after the user completes the test.

Step 3: Enhancements (Optional)

	•	Levels of Difficulty: You can modify the program to present different levels of difficulty by changing the length and complexity of the text. For example:
	•	Easy: Shorter sentences.
	•	Medium: Longer sentences.
	•	Hard: Text with more difficult vocabulary or more characters.
	•	Leaderboard: You could store the best typing speeds and accuracy percentages in a file or database to create a leaderboard for users to track their progress.
	•	GUI Interface: If you want a more advanced user interface, you could build a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing or JavaFX.

Example Output

Welcome to the Typing Speed Test!
You will be given a text to type. Try to type it as fast and accurately as possible.
Press ENTER to start the test.
Your text to type:
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

Start typing when you're ready. Press Enter to begin.
[User types: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog]
Test complete!
Time Taken: 5 seconds
Typing Speed: 60.00 words per minute
Accuracy: 100.00%

Conclusion

This program provides a basic typing speed test in Java, calculating typing speed (WPM) and accuracy. By using basic Java libraries, we can handle user input, timing, and string manipulation effectively. You can enhance this further by adding features like difficulty levels or GUL
